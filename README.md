# Spending Tracker

### an app to track spending and related finances
### created using: React Native, Rails, PostgresQL, Expo

## **Introduction**

I haven't had the time to work on a personal project for a while, although I also haven't had a great idea. I recently decided that I need to track my finances and right after opening the google play store, I realized I was a web developer andI should make my own.

This is a perfect project to continue my Rails learning and get more familiar with React Native an React Navigation.

## **Goals**

Besides getting more familiar with the intricacies of React Native & Navigation (I use them a ton at work), I also need to actually use GraphQL in a fully fleshed out project. I'm not sure when but I definitely plan on getting GraphQL into this app.

I plan on publishing this to the google play store for free, so this will be a long term project that I will try to make as complete as possible.

Eventually I want to create a web site interface, non-mobile, to extend some features and provide a nice landing page. This will also be a project where I realy focus on design and making this system look beautiful.
